- Evaluate if allocating memory from the Python heap reduces performance
  (what about the mallocs libuv does on its own?)

- FS module with all filesystem related functions from libuv

- Add support for spawning child processes: uv_spawn / uv_process_kill / uv_kill

- Better docstrings

- uv_tcp_nodelay / uv_tcp_keepalive / uv_tcp_simultaneous_accepts

- uv_udp_set_membership

- uv_fs_event

- Use PyStructSequence (similar to a named tuple) on stat and perhaps
  somewhere else as well

- Python 3 support

- Test it on Windows (MinGW)
