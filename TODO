NEW REFCOUNT
============

Option 1:
---------
Prevent Python callbacks from being called when object has been garbage collected.
Problem: the close() case is a bit tricky.


Option 2:
---------
Incref / decref Python objects and keep them alivewhen they are active.
Problem: what if I do read_start and lose a reference to the object?


Option 3:
---------
A mixture. Always close on dealloc. But do the incref trick for things that use a
request and whose callbacks will always be called. And fore close()

Test with Async.


Notes:
-----
    - Normal blocking sockets do write before getting closed
    - Store a struct in handle->data
      typedef struct handle_data_t {
        int flags;
        PyObject *obj;
      }

--------------

Option 3 looks best
