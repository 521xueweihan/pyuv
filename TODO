- Evaluate if allocating memory from the Python heap reduces performance
  (what about the mallocs libuv does on its own?)

- FS module with all filesystem related functions from libuv +  uv_fs_event
    - close
    - open
    - read
    - unlink
    - write
    - mkdir
    - rmdir
    - readdir
    - fstat
    - rename
    - fsync
    - fdatasync
    - ftruncate
    - sendfile
    - chmod
    - utime
    - futime
    - link

- Better docstrings

- Use PyStructSequence (similar to a named tuple) on stat and perhaps
  somewhere else as well

- Python 3 support

- Test it on Windows (MinGW)

- Support synchronous fs operations
