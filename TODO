- Evaluate if allocating memory from the Python heap reduces performance
  (what about the mallocs libuv does on its own?)

- FS module with all filesystem related functions from libuv +  uv_fs_event

- Better docstrings

- Use PyStructSequence (similar to a named tuple) on stat and perhaps
  somewhere else as well

- Python 3 support

- Test it on Windows (MinGW)
