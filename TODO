- Evaluate if allocating memory from the Python heap reduces performance
  (what about the mallocs libuv does on its own?)

- FS module with all filesystem related functions from libuv +  uv_fs_event
    - sendfile
    - utime
    - futime

- IPC: uv_start_read2, uv_write2

- Better docstrings

- Use PyStructSequence (similar to a named tuple) on stat and perhaps
  somewhere else as well

- Python 3 support

- Test it on Windows (MinGW)

- pid property to Process

- better memory allocation strategy for environment (Process)
